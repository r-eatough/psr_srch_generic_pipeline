# psr_srch_generic_pipeline
Often one needs a quick method to process pulsar search data. Because pulsar search pipelines can be very complex, with many dependencies, here I've tried to make a simple bash script that calls the commonly used search software from a container running on your system (like the one here). After creating a simple directory structure this should just work. 

## standalone bash script
TBD

## pbs bash script (to submit to a pbs job queue)
TBD
